# Frequency Counter Algorithm

## Overview

The Frequency Counter algorithm is a technique used in computer science to efficiently count the frequency of elements (usually integers or characters) in an array or string. It employs hash maps or objects to store the frequency of each element, providing an efficient way to solve certain problems.

## Use Cases

- **Anagram Detection**: Checking if two strings are anagrams by comparing their character frequencies.
- **Frequency Comparison**: Determining if one array is a rearrangement of another (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4] and [4, 3, 2, 1]).

- **Duplicate Detection**: Finding duplicates in an array or string efficiently.

- **Subset Checking**: Verifying if all elements in one list are present in another list with sufficient frequencies.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Frequency Counter algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array or string. This is because it typically involves iterating through the elements once to build the frequency map and then iterating through the map, which is generally linear with respect to the number of unique elements.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of the Frequency Counter algorithm is also O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of unique elements in the input array or string. This is due to the storage required for the hash map or object used to store the frequencies.

## When to Use

- **Large Inputs**: When dealing with large datasets where efficiency is crucial.
- **Frequency Comparison**: When comparing frequencies of elements between different arrays or strings.
- **Counting Occurrences**: When counting occurrences or frequencies of elements.

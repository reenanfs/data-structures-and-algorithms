# Sliding Window Algorithm

## Overview

The Sliding Window algorithm is a technique used in computer science to solve problems related to subarrays or substrings in an efficient manner. This method involves maintaining a window that slides over the data structure, adjusting its size dynamically based on the problem requirements. It is particularly useful for problems that involve finding maximum, minimum, or specific properties of subarrays or substrings in linear time.

## Use Cases

- **Maximum Sum Subarray**: Finding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of a specified length.
- **Minimum Sum Subarray**: Finding the minimum sum of any contiguous subarray of a specified length.
- **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Identifying the longest substring in which no characters repeat.
- **Subarrays with a Given Sum**: Counting or identifying subarrays that sum up to a specific target value.
- **Average of All Subarrays of Length K**: Calculating the average of all subarrays of a specified length.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Sliding Window algorithm is generally O(n), where n is the size of the array or string. This is because the window slides across the data structure once, ensuring a linear traversal.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of the Sliding Window algorithm is typically O(1) for fixed-size windows, as it only uses a few additional variables for storing the sum or other properties of the window. However, for variable-size windows or additional data structures, it may require O(n) space.

## When to Use

- **Fixed-Size Subarray/Substring Problems**: When the problem requires analysis of subarrays or substrings of a specific size.
- **Efficiency Matters**: When optimizing for linear time complexity without significant additional space.
- **Dynamic Window Size**: When the window size needs to adjust dynamically based on certain conditions.

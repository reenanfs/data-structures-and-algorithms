# Recursion Pattern

## Overview

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. This method is used to break down complex problems into simpler, more manageable sub-problems. Recursion is particularly useful for problems that can be divided into similar sub-problems or where the solution involves repetitive tasks.

## Use Cases

- **Factorial Calculation**: Computing the product of all positive integers up to a given number.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Generating a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- **Tree Traversal**: Navigating through tree data structures, such as in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversals.
- **Graph Traversal**: Exploring nodes in a graph using depth-first search (DFS).
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms like quicksort and mergesort that rely on recursive division.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of recursive algorithms depends on the nature of the problem and the specific implementation. Common complexities include:

- **Factorial Calculation**: O(n) where n is the number.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: O(2^n) for naive recursion, but can be optimized to O(n) using memoization.
- **Tree Traversal**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: O(n log n) for quicksort and mergesort on average.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of recursive algorithms often includes the space used by the call stack:

- **Factorial Calculation**: O(n) due to the depth of recursion.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: O(n) with memoization or O(n) without optimization.
- **Tree Traversal**: O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: O(log n) for quicksort due to recursive stack space, or O(n) for mergesort.

## When to Use

- **Divide and Conquer**: When a problem can be broken down into smaller sub-problems of the same type.
- **Simplified Code**: When recursion provides a clearer and more concise solution compared to iterative approaches.
- **Complex Data Structures**: When dealing with hierarchical or nested data structures like trees or graphs.

## Implementation Notes

- **Base Case**: Ensure that the recursion has a well-defined base case to prevent infinite recursion.
- **Problem Reduction**: Always ensure that each recursive call processes a smaller or reduced version of the problem to avoid infinite loops.
- **Stack Overflow**: Be cautious of stack overflow issues for deep recursion. Consider iterative solutions or optimization techniques like tail recursion if needed.
- **Memoization**: Utilize memoization to optimize recursive solutions where applicable and avoid redundant calculations.

Recursion is a powerful technique that can simplify the design and implementation of complex algorithms by leveraging self-referential solutions.

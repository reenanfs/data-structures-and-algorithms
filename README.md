# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repo serves as a documentation of my journey as I explore different data structures and algorithms. The content will be gradually filled with implementations, explanations, and examples as I learn and deepen my understanding.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- The `data-structures` and `algorithms` folders contain several subfolders representing specific data structures or algorithms.
- Each subfolder includes an `.md` file that provides detailed explanations and key insights about the corresponding topic.
- Within each data structure or algorithm subfolder, you will find language-specific subfolders, such as `python` and `typescript`, which contain implementation files in the respective programming languages.

Here's an example of the repository structure:

    data-structures
    ├── linked-list
    │   ├── linked_list.md
    │   ├── python
    │   │   └── linked_list.py
    │   └── typescript
    │       └── linkedList.ts
    ├── ...
    algorithms
    ├── ...

## Contributing

This repository is primarily intended for documenting my personal learning journey. However, if you find any errors, have suggestions, or wish to contribute additional implementations or improvements, you are welcome to create a pull request. I appreciate your support and collaboration!

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that the code is well-organized and follows best practices.

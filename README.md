# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository serves as a documentation of my learning journey as I explore different data structures and algorithms. The content will be gradually filled with implementations, explanations, and examples as I learn and deepen my understanding.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

    data-structures
    ├── linked-list
    │ ├── python
    │ │ └── linked_list.py
    │ └── typescript
    │ └── linkedList.ts
    ├── ...
    algorithms
    ├── ...

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

    data-structures
    ├── linked-list
    │ ├── python
    │ │ └── linked_list.py
    │ └── typescript
    │ └── linkedList.ts
    ├── ...
    algorithms
    ├── ...

The `data-structures` folder contains implementations of various data structures, while the `algorithms` folder contains implementations of different algorithms. Each data structure or algorithm has its own dedicated folder within the respective category.

Within each data structure or algorithm folder, you will find language-specific subfolders (such as `python` and `typescript`) that contain implementation files in the corresponding programming language.
